## 1. Looking into data in Excel

In this project I am using dataset provided by website kaggle.com (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows?resource=download).

Firstly I wanted to look into dataset. In order to do that I opened the Excel file and went to Data > Get & Transform Data > Get Data > From Text/CSV. Then I got the following:

I have table with 12 columns that contains the following informations:

- show_id - contains 
- type - contains 
- title - contains 
- director - contains 
- cast - contains 
- country - contains 
- date_added - contains 
- release_year- contains 
- rating- contains 
- duration- contains 
- listed_in - contains 
- description - contains

When we look into data we can see some issues that we will need to take care of. But we are not working on original datatset. Every modification will be made in Power BI. We do it that way because we do not want to destroy original dataset.
